        Hello! My name is Anushree Tyagi, and I am very curious about research. I love to do research in biology. 
        Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Technology specializing in bioinformatics at VIT Vellore, which is 
        one of the top engineering institutions in India. My journey of research work started in my childhood. My 
        grandfather was a great researcher, and he motivated me to do research work. My current CGPA is 8.95. I am 
        deeply intrigued by the transformative potential of bioinformatics technology and how it can help to develop 
        our society.

        Beyond academics, I also have a great interest in sports. During my school years, I represented my institution 
        in handball at the East Zonal level and played kabaddi at the state level. These experiences taught me the value 
        of teamwork, perseverance, and discipline. I also hold a blue belt in karate, which has equipped me with self-defense 
        skills and an unyielding spirit to tackle life's challenges. This karate once helped me to protect my brother from his 
        enemies. Sports have always been a cornerstone of my holistic development, complementing my academic pursuits.
