      Hello! My name is <strong style="color: #ff4747;">Anushree Tyagi</strong>, and I am very curious about research. I love to do research in biology. 
      Currently, I am pursuing a <em style="color: #ff4747;"><u>Bachelor of Technology</u></em> specializing in bioinformatics at VIT Vellore, which is  
      one of the top engineering institutions in India. My journey of research work started in my childhood. My grandfather was a great researcher and he motivated me to do research work. 
      My current <strong style="color: #ff4747;">CGPA is 8.95</strong>. I am deeply intrigued by the transformative potential of bioinformatics  
      technology and how it can help to develop our society.

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
      Beyond academics, I also have a great interest in sports. During my school years, I represented my institution in <strong style="color: #ff4747;">handball</strong> at 
      the East Zonal level and played <strong style="color: #ff4747;">kabaddi</strong> at the state level. These experiences taught me the value of teamwork, 
      perseverance, and discipline. I also hold a blue belt in karate, which has equipped me with self-defense skills and an unyielding 
      spirit to tackle life's challenges. This karate once helped me to protect my brother from his enemies. Sports have always been a cornerstone of my holistic development, complementing my academic pursuits.

    <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
      Professionally, I have had the privilege of interning at <strong style="color: #ff4747;">Sprinklr</strong>, where I gained hands-on experience in PCBM 
      assembly and database management. My great interest in research helped me to develop my thinking skills as well as to observe nature carefully. Recently, I am working on a research paper related to network and security. This zeal will help me to build a great career in research work.

  <div style="flex: 1; padding: 20px; margin: 10px; background-color: #f1f1f1; border-radius: 15px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">
    <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0;">
      My journey is not confined to academics and sports. I have actively participated in various clubs and seminars to expand my 
      horizons. My involvement in programs like <strong style="color: #838240;">D-Talk</strong> enhanced my speaking skills, allowing me to communicate ideas 
      effectively. I am also a firm believer in community service and have volunteered for initiatives that aim to uplift the underprivileged. 
      These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual ready to take on challenges with confidence.
